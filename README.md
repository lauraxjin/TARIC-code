# TARIC-code
==========
The TARIC-code web service assists users ( primarily EU custom officials and international exporters who export goods to the EU)to identify a particular good's TARIC-code(HS international trade product code plus an additional 4 digit EU code) from the HS hierarchical rules.

Data is divided in the hierarchical structure specified in the HS handbook(21 Sections and 96 Chapters).

  - **all-rules.html** shows a list of all the rules in the handbook,listed by the hierarchical structure. It is at the upper most level of the website, and it will support GET, POST, HEAD, and OPTIONS as I speficied in the previous assignment.
  - **rule.html** shows a specific trade product's path from the upper most level of the rules in the HS handbook to identifying the product's TARIC-code. And this page support GET, POST(Authentification needed), and DELETE(Authentification needed).
  - **rule-form.html** represents a user's query.
  - **find-rule.html** shows how the matching rule to the user's query is presented. This page supports GET.
